## Testing Process

1. **Generate Enhanced Index**:
   ```bash
   npm run generate-embeddings:force
   ```

2. **Test Each Query Category**:
   - Healthcare: Should prioritize medical capabilities
   - Enterprise: Should match business intelligence needs  
   - Government: Should surface civic technology options

3. **Verify Relevance**:
   - Match scores should be 80%+ for direct capability matches

## Next Steps

1. **Run Test Suite**: Test all 30 queries systematically
2. **Refine Scoring**: Adjust weights based on results
3. **Expand Keywords**: Add more domain-specific terms as needed
4. **User Feedback**: Collect feedback on capability vs. case study balance

This expanded system should now handle the full range of prospective buyer queries, returning relevant capabilities even for work types not explicitly showcased in the portfolio.
