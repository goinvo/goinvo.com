# Enhanced Search System Testing Guide

## Overview

The enhanced search system uses **intelligent keyword matching and semantic understanding** to surface the most relevant existing projects for any buyer query. Instead of creating separate capability entries, the system uses advanced keyword expansion and domain-specific boosting to help existing projects match a broader range of queries.
