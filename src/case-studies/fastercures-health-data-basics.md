# Engaging patients to understand health

### Problem

#### Patients don't understand what health data is or why it's important
Comprehension of health information is fundamental to well-being, patient empowerment, and decision making. Yet, 12% of the US adults are health literate and only 41% of individuals have accessed their medical record.

### Solution

#### Open source plugins for engagement
GoInvo crafted two open source plug-ins built on educational frameworks, gamification, and behavior change. FasterCures now has the framework for a tool to effectively educate and engage a wide range of patients about health data.

### Results

#### Educational retention
In a test with 30 patients, <span class="text--primary">97%</span> were able to recall the 5 main factors of health data and <span class="text--primary">90%</span> engaged with an online quiz.
