### Problem

#### Patients don't understand what health data is or why it's important
Comprehension of health information is fundamental to well-being, patient empowerment, and decision making. However, a scant 12% of US adults are health literate, and only 41% of individuals have even accessed their medical record. Driven by their mission to place patients first, FasterCures partnered with GoInvo to educate and engage patients on health data.[^1]

### Solution

#### Open source plugins for engagement
GoInvo crafted two open source plug-ins built on educational frameworks, gamification, and behavior change. FasterCures now has the framework for a tool to effectively educate and engage a wide range of patients about health data.

### Results

#### Educational retention
In a usability test for the educational materials conducted with 30 patients, 97% were able to recall the 5 main factors of health data, and 90% engaged with an online quiz.

## Process

#### Research through multiple techniques
GoInvo and FasterCures conducted a survey of approximately 700 patients and in depth interviews with 15 industry experts that informed user needs, barriers, and motivations. In addition, we explored and reviewed the latest research on patient engagement, health literacy, and patient education. Insights gained helped the design team to understand the overall audience, their needs and motivations around understanding health data, as well as to formulate  a health data definition around the social determinants of health.

#### Generate a range of concepts
GoInvo considered a variety of design methods to engage patients, generating early renderings and summaries of over 30 concepts, which included digital, physical, and social exhibits.

#### Prioritize rigorously
We narrowed our 30 concepts based on reach, educational impact, and scalability. Then, in collaboration with FasterCures and a panel of patient stakeholders, we weighed these factors as well as the goals of the projects to select the right concept to pursue.

## Insights & recommendations

![something](/images/vision/vision-hero.jpg)

#### Integrate Social Determinants of Health
We identified the need for an expanded definition of health data that went beyond medical records and devices to include the social determinants of health. We have pushed this more accurate and holistic definition as a new norm.

#### Start with health. Not health data.
Patients seek especially to understand health data to accomplish their larger goal of living healthy but typically pursue an understanding of health data to help them with their larger goal of living well. With this knowledge, we were able to hone the approach and further focus the message.

#### Uncover a market need for a data visualization
As part of the ideation phase, we created a preliminary map of the health data ecosystem. This inspired a separate data visualization project that outlined the path to build a transparent, trusting, and collaborative ecosystem where patients were empowered to share their data.

## Solution

#### Educational open source plugins
GoInvo crafted two open source plug-in designs built on educational frameworks, gamification, and behavior change. These are intended to be reused across app onboardings and web services.

#### Engagement through narrative
The introduction hooks an individual with a graphic that appeals to their sense of curiosity to discover that there is more to health data than medical care. Individuals then unravel the surprising ways in which wellness and health data permeate life through an array of interactive examples.

#### Designed with behavior change frameworks
The prototype integrates the Health Belief Model, covering the mental processes which inform whether an individual will make a change. These factors include benefits, susceptibility, severity, barriers and modifying variables, cues to action and self efficacy. For example, users that cite a lack of time as a barrier to exercise have their concerns addressed through a suggestion that individuals get off the bus stop one stop early.

#### Gamification for knowledge retention
Quizzes encouraged interaction with information and as a result, knowledge retention. One technique appealed to an individual’s sense of caretaking with a sprout that grows into a plant for every correct answers, while another to an individual’s sense of novelty through guessing the health data sound and little  hearts that act as progress indicators.

#### Validation with patients
Thirty patients reviewed the two prototypes, and completed a survey measuring trust, credibility, usability, and appearance. Twenty-nine out of thirty patients correctly identified the five factors of health data, demonstrating the  effectiveness of the educational tool.
