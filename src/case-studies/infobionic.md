# Mobile health design for real-time cardiac arrhythmias

### Problem

InfoBionic created a patient worn device that reported arrhythmias in real-time for doctors and nurses to review. To convince doctors and investors, InfoBionic needed a way to show the product in action.

### Solution

GoInvo crafted an iPad application to help providers and investors envision InfoBionic’s value.

### Results

GoInvo delivered the vision for how doctors would use the product, and investors noticed. The design led to a patent on [processing and displaying electrocardiograph data](https://www.google.com/patents/US8620418) and received FDA approval and CE Mark for cardiac arrhythmia monitoring. InfoBionic [closed $17M Series B financing](https://infobionic.com/infobionic-17m-series-b-close-new-team-members/).

## Insights

We worked closely with cardiac arrhythmia experts, including Mass General Hospital. Receiving continual feedback helped us pivot quickly and land on a solution that providers would gravitate towards.

## Solution

Doctors and nurses can monitor a patient’s arrhythmias in real-time, remotely. Use of color in the real-time charts could effectively and quickly highlight problem areas. In seconds, a provider could see the status and health of all their patients and easily identify who needs their attention.

The patient timeline along the top shows detected cardiac events, heart-rate, and physical activity across time to aid doctors in quickly understanding the patient's health. Machine- and patient-detected arrhythmias paired with important metadata such as physical activity and time of day to help providers diagnose an issue.

## Result

Because of how much providers loved the design, InfoBionic was able to gather the funding needed to apply for a patent on [processing and displaying electrocardiograph data](https://www.google.com/patents/US8620418) and received FDA approval and CE Mark for cardiac arrhythmia monitoring.
