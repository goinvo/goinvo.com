# What’s the Status of US Healthcare?

for the MITRE Corporation

### Problem

The major issues and statistics for US healthcare are tough to understand and see, even in a data and analysis-rich “command” center, let alone on your phone. The MITRE Health Lab needed a large-scale, national healthcare storytelling service, to show public health officials, researchers, and policy makers the ground truth.

### Solution

An interactive healthcare story engine that help scientists to showcase their work in context of national problem sets and information.

### Results

We designed and shipped an open source touch screen service to show public health information and stories.

## Understanding the problem

#### Seeing National Problems with a flick of a finger

Located across the street from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid in Baltimore, and a hub of healthcare policy meetings, the MITRE HealthLab needed an interactive, visual story engine to walkthrough national healthcare issues, statistics, and projects.

#### Look across the nation, act locally

Using global, national, and local data sources, together we crafted key questions and US Healthcare storylines.

## Solution

#### Fast sketching and prototyping

Storylines were first written in short paragraph form, evolved through and accompanied with rough storyboards, evidence, and graphic representations.

#### Large scale technical storytelling, for a technical audience

A 12-LCD panel wide touchscreen data wall was the primary display for healthcare walk-throughs. The company that provided the interactive panels hogties the software by making it impossible to customize the customer experience… unless they are contracted to design and engineer the new functions. Their customer service for everyday problems was very good; the business model is a detriment to innovation, self-curation, and evolving the software from outside their firewall.

We worked around this closed “feature” by extending the built-in Chrome browser to extend contiguously across all 12 touch screens. We then build a custom experience using open web standards at a fraction of the cost, pain, and time.

## Results

#### Open Source Scientific Storytelling

MITRE open sourced the US Healthcare Dashboard experience so other government agencies and healthcare companies can use, update, and evolve the interactive stories.

#### “Wow... that’s amazing!”

Easily seen from 70 feet away from the entrance of the building, the US Healthcare Dashboard draws in visitors and staff.
