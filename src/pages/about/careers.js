My friends at Invo mentored and supported me as I learned design basics. But beyond just aiming for design competency, I was also challenged to consider the broader impact of the work -- its effect on patients, on access to healthcare, and on health as a whole. If you want to work at a place that challenges you, supports you, and infuses your work with a sense of purpose, come to Invo.</Quote>

It was an inspiring environment to do meaningful work with a family of driven, talented people.</Quote>
