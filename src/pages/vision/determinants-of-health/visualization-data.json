Some biological and genetic factors that have varying impacts on different segments of the population, and so variance must be considered when applying the determinants of health. The effects of aging and inherited conditions (sickle-cell anemia, cystic fibrosis, etc.) are examples of factors with varying levels of impact on the population."

This combination can be very dangerous since the high cost of care and lack of knowledge may cause patients to delay seeking medical treatment."
