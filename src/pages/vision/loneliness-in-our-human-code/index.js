              <p>
                Among social determinants of health, loneliness can hugely
                impact a personâ€™s mental state, physical health, and overall
                wellbeing. In this brief, we explore how social determinants of
                health, with a focus on loneliness, affect health over the
                course of a lifespan, taking into consideration the unique
                circumstances and needs at each stage of life.

                  The default for the human brain is to assess and respond to
                  our social context and stimuli, otherwise known as our

                  oxytocin) along with healthy function in the parts of our

                        relationships, and geographic residences that may mean
                        leaving family for the first time. This change is often
                        characterized by the constant forming, breaking, and
                        reforming of social bonds. This is why having a constant
                        source of social support can have major impacts on
                        health and life satisfaction. In fact, if a person has a
                        friend they see on most days, it has a similar impact on
                        life satisfaction as would earning an extra $100,00 of
                        income.

                        emotional and physical. While the likelihood of losing
                        someone is equal across age groups, many adults see some
                        of their friendships weaken as a product of building a
                        family or experience the passing of a parent or spouse.
                        In terms of life satisfaction, when we break a social
